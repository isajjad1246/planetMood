# hackHERS2021project
For our HackHERS submission, we decided to create a website that is space-themed but also deals with mental health. We wanted to make something interactive that could also serve as a reminder to take care of yourself. We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the website. 

The website can be accessed here: https://www.bit.ly/PlanetMood

The user would go on the homepage and choose a planet that relates to their mood, and they can see what activity is on there to make them feel better. Each planet correlates to a certain mood and prompts the user to another page with ways to cope with that emotion, whether it be through videos, reminders, or tasks to accomplish.
